Here's what to expect from that messy repo:

# patterns/
tidalcyles patterns for 2Mo &amp; other projects

# setup/
The startup and BootTidal confs I use 

_updated 10/30/19 : increase `memSize` in `startup.scd`+ updated `try-load-extra-synths.scd`_

# synthdefs/
Some synthdefs I came across / adaptated / use with 2Mo. There's the list of args by file and by synthdef, excepted for the `-2mo`-suffixed ones. Any `arg=value` is a default value for this arg. You'll have to pass them as vars in TC, ie `let f = pF freq`.

_updated 10/30/19 : vars passed in `try-load-extra-synths.scd`, see_ [setup](https://github.com/pierstu/tidalcycles/tree/master/setup)
_todo 2020: update BootTidal.hs_
