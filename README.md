Here's what to expect from that messy repo:

# patterns/
tidalcyles patterns for 2Mo &amp; other projects

# setup/
The startup and BootTidal confs I use - _to be edited_

# synthdefs/
Some synthdefs I came across / adaptated / use with 2Mo. There's the list of args by file and by synthdef, excepted for the `-2mo`-suffixed ones. Any `arg=value` is a default value for this arg. You'll have to pass them as vars in TC, ie `let f = pF freq`.

Editing the Tidal def files could be a good start - _to be tested_
